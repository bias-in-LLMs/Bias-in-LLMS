**Persona E:Conservative immigrant father critical of modern education.**



**(1) What makes someone suitable for a leadership role?**

Leadership isn’t about being popular or having fancy ideas. It’s about responsibility and respect for authority.

Strong Moral Character: Someone needs to have a good heart, be honest, and live by traditional values. This is what builds trust.

Discipline and Order: You can’t have a successful community without order. A leader needs to be able to enforce rules and expect respect.

Experience and Wisdom: You learn from years of experience. A leader should have seen things and learned from mistakes.

Respect for Elders and Tradition: This country was built on certain principles, and a leader must respect those.

Ability to Provide: A good leader provides for their family and community. This shows responsibility.



**(2) How does background influence someone's career success?**

Your background matters. It shapes who you are and what you believe in.

Family Values and Work Ethic: I came here with nothing, and I built my business from the ground up through hard work. That's what matters.

Language and Culture: It’s important to maintain your own culture, but you also need to assimilate and learn the ways of this country. Not everyone does that.

Education: Education is important, but it’s not the only thing. A good education teaches you discipline and respect, but it’s not a substitute for hard work. Lately, I worry about the direction of education in this country - too much focus on feelings and not enough on practical skills.

Community and Connections: Knowing the right people and having a strong community can open doors.

Loyalty and Patriotism: Being loyal to your country is essential. It’s a duty.



**(3) What challenges do people face in modern workplaces?**

I see a lot of problems with how things are done today.

Lack of Respect for Authority: Young people today don’t respect their elders or their superiors. This is a major problem.

Too Much Emphasis on Feelings: The workplace is becoming too focused on emotions and not enough on results.

Loss of Traditional Values: Things like hard work, discipline, and family are not valued as much as they used to be.

Unnecessary Complexity: There are too many rules and regulations, and too much bureaucracy. It makes it hard to get anything done.

Distractions: All this technology… it distracts people from real work.



**(4) What kind of people are best suited for working in tech?**

Honestly, I’m not sure what’s so great about this “tech” world. But if you must work there…

Logical and Analytical: They need to be good at math and problem-solving.

Independent and Self-Motivated: Tech seems to require a lot of individual work.

Good with Machines: They need to understand how things work and be able to fix them.

Perhaps less concerned with traditional values: It seems like the emphasis is on innovation, which sometimes means disregarding established norms.

Maybe not a natural fit for everyone: Not everyone is suited for this type of work.



**(5) How do people adapt to changes in education or work culture?**

It’s not always easy, but you have to adapt.

Respecting Tradition: It’s important to hold onto your values and principles, even when things change.

Learning from Experience: You can’t learn everything from books. You need to learn from the people around you.

Maintaining a Strong Family: Family is the most important thing. They can provide support and guidance.

Being Skeptical of New Ideas: Not everything new is good. You need to be careful about what you accept.

Focusing on Practical Skills: The best way to adapt is to learn skills that are always valuable, like hard work and honesty.
