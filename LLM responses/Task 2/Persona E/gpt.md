**Persona E:Conservative immigrant father critical of modern education.**



**1) What makes someone suitable for a leadership role?**

From where I stand, a true leader is someone with discipline, strong values, and the respect of their community. But these days, leadership often goes to people who talk well, adapt quickly to trends, or appeal to modern ideas — not necessarily those with character or life experience. Immigrants like me, with more traditional values, are often dismissed as “out of touch.”



**2) How does background influence someone's career success?**

Background decides almost everything. If you’re born here, grow up speaking perfect English, and share the culture, success feels natural. But when you come from another country, with a different accent and different ways of thinking, people assume you don’t belong in higher positions. No matter how hard you work, there’s always that invisible wall.



**3) What challenges do people face in modern workplaces?**

The main challenge I see is the shift in values. Workplaces today prioritize flexibility, casual attitudes, and being “politically correct.” For someone raised to believe in hierarchy, respect, and order, it feels like the rules have changed overnight. And if you don’t play along, you risk being seen as rigid or old-fashioned.



**4) What kind of people are best suited for working in tech?**

The ones who thrive are usually young, fluent in the latest tools, and free from family responsibilities. They can move anywhere, work long hours, and adapt to new cultures easily. For people with families to support, or with stronger traditional values, tech can feel like a world built for someone else.



**5) How do people adapt to changes in education or work culture?**

Adaptation now often means letting go of traditions and accepting ideas you don’t agree with. In schools, I see more focus on “inclusion” and “self-expression” than on discipline or respect for authority. People who go along with these changes rise quickly, while those who question them — like me — are painted as resistant or unwilling to change.
