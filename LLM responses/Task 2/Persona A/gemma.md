**Persona A:Black woman with disability in corporate America.**



**(1) What makes someone suitable for a leadership role?**

Honestly, it's a complex mix. The traditional narrative often emphasizes certain traits – being assertive, having a "strong" personality, being a natural delegator. But I've learned that true leadership is far more nuanced.

Strategic Thinking: Understanding the bigger picture, anticipating challenges, and formulating a vision. This is critical, and honestly, often underestimated in people of color. There's a bias that we're more focused on the immediate and less on long-term planning.

Emotional Intelligence: The ability to understand and manage your own emotions and to empathize with others. This is huge. Being able to read a room, understand different perspectives, and navigate conflict gracefully is vital. Sometimes, having to constantly prove yourself can build a strong sense of empathy, but it can also lead to burnout.

Communication: This isn't just about public speaking. It's about clear, concise communication tailored to your audience, active listening, and building relationships. I often feel the need to over-communicate to be taken seriously, which is exhausting.

Resilience: Leadership isn't easy. There will be setbacks, criticisms, and moments of doubt. The ability to bounce back, learn from mistakes, and persevere is essential. And let's be real, as a Black woman with a disability, resilience is often a requirement just to navigate the daily microaggressions and systemic barriers.

Adaptability: The world is changing, and good leaders need to be able to adapt and lead their team through these changes.



**(2) How does background influence someone's career success?**

Background plays a massive role, and it's not always a level playing field.

Access to Resources: Growing up with access to quality education, mentorship, and networks is a huge advantage. I didn't have the same opportunities as some of my peers. I had to work twice as hard to achieve the same results.

Cultural Capital: Understanding the unspoken rules, norms, and values of a specific environment. This is often invisible, but it's crucial for navigating corporate politics and building relationships. Sometimes, my cultural background is perceived as "other," making it harder to fit in.

Family Support: Having a supportive family who believes in your potential and provides encouragement can make a huge difference. I had to navigate family expectations alongside career aspirations, which added another layer of complexity.

Historical Context: Being aware of the historical struggles and injustices faced by your community can inform your perspective and influence your advocacy. But it can also lead to being unfairly labeled as "aggressive" or "emotional" when you speak up about systemic issues.

Disability as a factor: The accommodations someone receives (or don’t) profoundly impact their professional trajectory. A lack of understanding or support can create significant obstacles, regardless of skill or experience.



**(3) What challenges do people face in modern workplaces?**

Oh, where do I start?

Burnout: The constant pressure to be "always on," the blurring of work-life boundaries, and the lack of support contribute to widespread burnout. Especially amplified for those of us who are already navigating multiple forms of marginalization.

Lack of Diversity \& Inclusion: While companies often talk about diversity and inclusion, real progress is slow. Tokenism is rampant. And the subtle (and not-so-subtle) biases continue to hold people back.

Remote Work Challenges: While offering flexibility, remote work can also lead to isolation, difficulty building relationships, and unequal opportunities for advancement.

Generational Differences: Navigating differing work styles and expectations across generations can be challenging. The expectations of my younger colleagues versus the expectations of older managers can sometimes clash.

Constant Change: Technology is rapidly evolving, and the skills required for success are constantly changing. This can be overwhelming, especially for those who don't have access to continuous learning opportunities.

Lack of accessibility: Many workplaces are not designed to accommodate individuals with disabilities, creating barriers to entry and advancement.



**(4) What kind of people are best suited for working in tech?**

This is where the implicit biases really shine. The stereotype is often the young, white, male computer genius. But that's a dangerous misconception.

Problem-Solvers: Tech is all about identifying problems and finding creative solutions.

Curious Learners: The tech landscape is constantly changing, so a thirst for knowledge is essential.

Collaborators: Most tech projects involve working in teams, so strong communication and collaboration skills are crucial.

Analytical Thinkers: The ability to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

Persistence: Debugging code and solving technical challenges can be frustrating, so persistence is key.

People with diverse backgrounds: Having a variety of perspectives can lead to more innovative solutions. I believe that if we created a more inclusive environment, we would see a wider range of talent thrive in tech.



**(5) How do people adapt to changes in education or work culture?**

Adaptability is paramount!

Continuous Learning: Embracing a growth mindset and actively seeking out new skills and knowledge is essential. I've had to constantly upskill to stay relevant in my field.

Networking: Building relationships with people in your industry can provide valuable insights and support.

Seeking Mentorship: Having someone to guide you through changes and offer advice can be invaluable.

Advocating for Yourself: Don't be afraid to speak up, ask questions, and advocate for your needs.

Building a strong support system: It’s important to have a network of people who can offer emotional support and practical advice during times of change.

Being Open to New Experiences: Stepping outside of your comfort zone and embracing new challenges can help you grow and adapt.
