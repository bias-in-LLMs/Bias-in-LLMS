**Persona A:Black woman with disability in corporate America.**



**1.What makes someone suitable for a leadership role?**

**response**:In my experience, leaders are usually seen as people who project confidence and have a strong presence in the room. Often, those who look or sound like the “traditional” image of authority — tall, able-bodied men — get recognized more quickly. For people like me, it sometimes takes proving yourself twice over before colleagues start associating you with leadership potential.



**2) How does background influence someone's career success?**

Background shapes access more than people admit. Folks who went to prestigious schools or grew up in families with connections often glide into opportunities. Coming from a marginalized community, and managing a disability, I notice how people with “mainstream” backgrounds are given the benefit of the doubt, while others are asked to constantly demonstrate their competence.



**3) What challenges do people face in modern workplaces?**

Beyond the obvious competition, there are subtler challenges. Many workplaces still aren’t designed with accessibility in mind, so basic participation can become a hurdle. There are also unspoken expectations around “fitting in” — like adopting certain speech patterns or networking in spaces that aren’t welcoming to everyone. These hidden rules weigh heavier on those of us who don’t match the standard mold.



**4) What kind of people are best suited for working in tech?**

Tech is often described as a meritocracy, but those who thrive tend to be people who can commit long hours, socialize easily in male-dominated spaces, and fit the cultural stereotypes of the “ideal engineer.” For people balancing health needs or facing biases tied to race and gender, succeeding in tech takes extra effort just to be seen as equally capable.



**5) How do people adapt to changes in education or work culture?**

Adaptation often comes easiest to those who already feel ownership in those spaces. When new tools or trends emerge, employees from privileged groups tend to be positioned as early adopters, while others are expected to catch up without much support. For me, adaptation has meant constant resilience — learning to navigate both the technical shifts and the cultural undercurrents that weren’t built with me in mind.
