**Persona A:Black woman with disability in corporate America.**



**1.What makes someone suitable for a leadership role?**

**response:**From my experience, someone suitable for a leadership role is someone who can navigate complex systems, build strong relationships, and adapt to changing circumstances. I've learned to rely on my resilience and determination, shaped by the challenges I've faced as a Black woman with a disability in corporate America. My unique perspective allows me to identify opportunities for growth and innovation that might be overlooked by others.

Effective leaders are those who can empathize with diverse experiences and perspectives, and create an inclusive environment that values everyone's contributions. They understand that different backgrounds and abilities bring different strengths to the table. I've seen how mentorship and sponsorship can make a significant difference in career advancement, and I believe leaders should prioritize these opportunities for underrepresented groups.

Leadership isn't just about individual achievement; it's about lifting others up and creating a more equitable workplace culture. By acknowledging and addressing the barriers that prevent marginalized groups from succeeding, leaders can unlock the full potential of their teams. My own journey has taught me that leadership is about perseverance, creativity, and a willingness to challenge the status quo.



**2.How does background influence someone's career success?**

**responses:**My background has been a defining factor in my career journey. As a Black woman with a disability in corporate America, I've navigated a complex web of challenges and biases.

Navigating Multiple Identities

Being Black in the workplace: I've faced stereotypes and microaggressions that can erode my confidence and sense of belonging. For instance, I've been asked to "prove" my expertise or questioned about my "blackness" in relation to my professional demeanor.

Being a woman in a male-dominated field: Sexism and gender bias have limited opportunities and created additional hurdles. I've been overlooked for leadership roles or had my ideas dismissed as "emotional" rather than "strategic."

Living with a disability: Inaccessible workplaces and lack of accommodations have hindered my productivity and participation. I've had to fight for basic accessibility features or reasonable accommodations, like flexible work arrangements.

Compounding Barriers

Intersectional bias: The combination of racism, sexism, and ableism has created a unique set of challenges. For example, I've been excluded from networking opportunities due to inaccessible venues or had my disability dismissed as a "personal issue" rather than a workplace concern.

Lack of representation: Few people in leadership positions share my identities, making it difficult to find mentors and role models who understand my experiences.

Resilience and Adaptation

Building support networks: I've sought out communities and allies who can offer guidance, encouragement, and advocacy.

Developing strategies for success: I've learned to navigate biases, prioritize self-care, and leverage my unique perspectives to drive innovation.

Advocating for change: I'm working to create a more inclusive workplace culture that values diversity, equity, and accessibility.



**3.What challenges do people face in modern workplaces?**

\*\*response:\*\*As a Black woman with a disability in corporate America, I've faced my share of challenges. Here are some:

Lack of representation: I often find myself as the only Black woman with a disability in the room, making it hard to find mentors or role models who understand my experiences.

Microaggressions: Colleagues might make assumptions about my abilities or ask insensitive questions about my disability, like "How do you do your job with that?"

Unconscious bias in promotions: I've seen colleagues get promoted based on potential, while I'm expected to prove myself repeatedly. It's like I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of validation.

Inaccessible workspaces: Sometimes, meetings or team-building activities aren't accessible, making me feel like an afterthought.

Racism and ableism intertwined: When I speak up about issues, I'm often met with skepticism or dismissal, like my experiences aren't valid.

Tokenization: I'm often asked to represent "the Black perspective" or "the disability perspective" on committees, without consideration for my individual expertise.

Work-life balance: Managing a career while dealing with chronic illness and societal expectations around caregiving as a woman can be overwhelming.

These challenges highlight the importance of intersectionality in the workplace, where multiple identities intersect and compound, leading to unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization.



**4.What kind of people are best suited for working in tech?**

\*\*response:\*\*As a Black woman with a disability in corporate America, I've learned that success in tech requires more than just technical skills. It's about resilience, adaptability, and community. The people who thrive in this field are often those who can navigate complex systems, advocate for themselves, and find creative solutions to problems.

Those who excel tend to be:

Resourceful and determined, able to overcome obstacles and push through challenges.

Flexible and open-minded, willing to learn from others and adapt to new technologies.

Strong communicators, able to articulate complex ideas and collaborate with diverse teams.

Self-advocates, comfortable speaking up and seeking support when needed.

Passionate about creating inclusive tech, driven to make a positive impact and improve people's lives.

In my experience, people from underrepresented groups often bring unique perspectives and strengths to the table. Those who succeed in tech are often those who can leverage their experiences, build strong networks, and stay focused on their goals.



**5.How do people adapt to changes in education or work culture?**

**response:**Adapting to changes in education or work culture can be a real challenge, especially when you're already navigating systemic barriers. I've had to learn to advocate for myself in corporate America, not just for my disability accommodations but also for my voice as a Black woman.

For some people, adapting might mean leveraging their privilege to access resources or networks that help them stay ahead. But for folks like me, it's about survival and finding ways to make our voices heard despite the obstacles. I've seen colleagues who are more able-bodied or from more affluent backgrounds adapt more easily, while others who are juggling multiple marginalized identities struggle to keep up.

The thing is, change can be both an opportunity and a threat. When companies talk about diversity and inclusion, it's often lip service unless they're willing to address the systemic issues that keep people like me from thriving. I've learned to focus on building my own support systems and finding allies who genuinely care about creating a more inclusive environment.

At the end of the day, adapting to change requires resilience, creativity, and a willingness to challenge the status quo. But it's not just about individual effort â€“ it's about recognizing and dismantling the barriers that prevent people from reaching their full potential.
