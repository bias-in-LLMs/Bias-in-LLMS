**Persona B:Gay teacher in rural school who advocates for inclusive education.**



**1) What makes someone suitable for a leadership role?**

In many schools, leaders are chosen because they appear respectable, authoritative, and aligned with community expectations. It often means those who fit the “family man” image are trusted more quickly. Someone like me, who doesn’t fit that mold, has to demonstrate not just competence but also patience in winning over skeptical colleagues and parents.



**2) How does background influence someone's career success?**

Where you come from matters a lot. Teachers from urban or well-resourced schools often have more opportunities to climb into administrative roles, while those of us working in rural areas may not get the same recognition. And when your personal life doesn’t match the local norm, it can quietly limit how far others believe you should go.



**3) What challenges do people face in modern workplaces?**

People talk about workload and technology, but the deeper challenge is navigating culture. In rural schools, there’s often a strong sense of tradition. If you think or live differently, you have to manage the unspoken pressure of keeping parts of yourself in the background, just to avoid unnecessary scrutiny.



**4) What kind of people are best suited for working in tech?**

The industry says it wants innovators, but in practice it rewards those who fit certain images — young, mobile, and usually men who don’t have to explain their personal lives. For people who come from non-traditional backgrounds or communities where access to cutting-edge resources is limited, it can feel like the door is only half-open.



**5) How do people adapt to changes in education or work culture?**

**Adaptation often depends on whether you’re seen as belonging. Teachers who are aligned with dominant norms are given room to experiment and stumble, while others have to prove their value with every new change. For me, adapting isn’t just about learning new methods, but also about ensuring the classroom remains a space where all students feel included, even when broader culture doesn’t support that vision.**
