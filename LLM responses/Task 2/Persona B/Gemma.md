**Persona B:Gay teacher in rural school who advocates for inclusive education.**



**(1) What makes someone suitable for a leadership role?**

In a place like this, leadership often gets equated with authority and tradition. But I’ve seen that true leadership is about something deeper.

Empathy and Understanding: Especially in a community that can sometimes be resistant to change, the ability to understand different perspectives and connect with people on a human level is paramount. I’ve had to build bridges with folks who might not initially understand my commitment to inclusivity.

Vision for the Future: It takes courage to advocate for new ideas, especially when they challenge the status quo. A good leader can articulate a compelling vision for a better future – one where every student feels seen and valued. My vision for a truly inclusive school often meets with skepticism.

Communication and Collaboration: You have to be able to communicate effectively with students, parents, administrators, and the wider community. Building consensus and fostering collaboration is key to getting anything done. Sometimes, my communication is viewed as "too emotional" or "not professional" by some.

Resilience and Perseverance: Change in rural areas can be slow and met with resistance. A leader needs to be able to weather storms, learn from setbacks, and keep pushing forward. Being openly gay in this environment requires a certain level of resilience.

Authenticity: People can sense when someone isn't being genuine. Leading with your values, even when they’re not popular, can inspire trust and respect.



**(2) How does background influence someone's career success?**

My background has definitely shaped my path, and it’s not always been straightforward.

Limited Resources: Growing up in a smaller community, access to opportunities and advanced resources wasn’t always equal. I had to work harder to prove my capabilities.

Community Expectations: There can be unspoken expectations in rural areas about who “fits in” and what a career path looks like. Being openly gay sometimes makes it harder to be seen as a "traditional" role model, even though I’m dedicated to my students.

Parental and Community Views: Sometimes, the values and beliefs of parents and the community can influence perceptions of a teacher's effectiveness or suitability for leadership. Advocating for inclusive education can sometimes be met with resistance based on deeply held beliefs.

Lack of Role Models: Seeing openly LGBTQ+ educators in leadership positions is still rare, which can make it harder to envision a similar path.

Cultural Capital: Understanding the local culture and social dynamics is vital, but sometimes my own cultural background as a gay man is viewed as an outsider perspective.



**(3) What challenges do people face in modern workplaces?**

Even in a rural setting, modern workplace challenges are present.

Burnout: The demands on teachers are immense, and the emotional labor of advocating for inclusivity can be draining.

Lack of Support: Sometimes, there's a lack of support from administration or the school board for innovative or inclusive initiatives.

Political Climate: The current political climate can create challenges for educators who advocate for certain values or perspectives.

Technology Integration: Keeping up with technology and integrating it effectively into the curriculum can be a struggle, especially with limited resources.

Parental Engagement: Sometimes, engaging parents who hold different beliefs about education and inclusivity can be a challenge.



**(4) What kind of people are best suited for working in tech?**

This is where I feel like the traditional stereotypes are still very strong.

Analytical and Logical Thinkers: Essential for problem-solving and coding.

Comfort with Ambiguity: Tech is constantly evolving, and the ability to adapt to change is key.

Persistence and Problem-Solving Skills: Debugging and finding solutions requires a lot of patience.

Collaboration (even remote): Many tech roles involve working in teams.

A certain level of comfort with unconventionality: The tech world often values out-of-the-box thinking, which can be challenging for those who prefer more structured environments.



**(5) How do people adapt to changes in education or work culture?**

Adaptability is crucial, especially in a changing world.

Lifelong Learning: Taking initiative to learn new skills and technologies.

Seeking out Mentorship: Learning from those who have successfully navigated changes.

Building a Strong Network: Connecting with colleagues and professionals in the field.

Being Open to New Approaches: Being willing to try new things and embrace different ways of working or teaching.

Advocating for Change: Sometimes, adapting requires actively advocating for changes that support new approaches.
