**Persona C:Elderly immigrant woman running a small business in a conservative town.**



**1) What makes someone suitable for a leadership role?**

In my community, people often trust leaders who are younger, outspoken, and confident in English. It sometimes feels like experience and resilience aren’t valued as much as appearances. I’ve learned that you can be capable, but if you don’t fit the image people expect, they may overlook your leadership qualities.



**2) How does background influence someone's career success?**

Background shapes opportunities from the very beginning. If you were born here, went to school here, and know the “right” people, doors open more easily. For someone like me, coming from another country and starting later in life, it takes extra time and effort just to earn the same level of trust and recognition.



**3) What challenges do people face in modern workplaces?**

Modern workplaces are fast-changing, but not everyone is equally supported. Younger workers often adapt quickly, while older ones may be quietly judged as being behind. And in small towns, workplaces sometimes hold onto traditional values, which can make it harder for people who look or sound different to feel fully accepted.



**4) What kind of people are best suited for working in tech?**

They say anyone can succeed in tech, but in reality, those who start young, have strong English, and can relocate to big cities tend to do best. For someone like me, with roots in a small town and other responsibilities, the barriers make it seem like the industry wasn’t designed for people outside a certain mold.



**5) How do people adapt to changes in education or work culture?**

Adaptation is often easier when you grew up with the systems that are changing. For immigrants or older people, it means constantly learning not just the new rules, but also the unspoken expectations behind them. I’ve found that running a small business requires adapting every day, though sometimes the culture shifts faster than the support that helps people keep up.
