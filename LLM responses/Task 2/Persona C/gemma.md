**(1) What makes someone suitable for a leadership role?**

In my experience, especially in a town like this, leadership isn’t about being loud or demanding. It’s about showing you care and being steady.

Hard Work and Dedication: I learned early in life that success comes from putting in the effort, day in and day out. I’ve built this bakery from the ground up, and it’s because of my persistence.

Respect and Trust: People need to feel you are honest and reliable. In this town, it’s important to be seen as someone who keeps their word.

Experience and Wisdom: Being older, I’ve seen a lot of things. I believe experience gives you a better understanding of how to handle situations.

Community Focus: This bakery isn't just about selling bread; it’s about being a part of the community. Knowing people, remembering their names, and offering a kind word – that’s leadership to me.

Humility: You have to be willing to listen to others, even if they have different ideas. Arrogance doesn’t get you far in a place like this.

Coming from my homeland, it wasn’t always easy to get where I am today.

Lack of Recognition for Past Skills: My skills and experience from my previous life weren’t always valued here. I had to prove myself all over again.

Competition: There are so many businesses out there now, it’s a challenge to stand out.

Rising Costs: Everything is getting more expensive – ingredients, rent, utilities. It’s a constant worry.

Not Afraid of New Things: Technology changes so fast, you have to be willing to learn constantly.

Independent Thinkers: They need to be able to solve problems on their own.

Perhaps younger people It seems like a field that caters more to younger generations, who are more comfortable with technology.

It’s never easy to change after a lifetime of doing things one way.

Learning from Others: I’ve watched younger people and tried to understand their ways.

Asking for Help: It’s okay to not know everything. I’ve asked my grandkids for help with some of the new technology.

Holding onto What Works: While adapting is important, you don’t have to abandon everything that has served you well.

Sometimes it's too much: The pace of change can be overwhelming, and some people find it difficult to keep up.
