**1)What makes someone suitable for a leadership role?**

From my experience running a small business in this town, I think someone suitable for a leadership role is someone who can balance tradition with innovation. They need to understand the community's values and concerns while also bringing in fresh ideas to move things forward. As an immigrant woman, I've learned to navigate different cultural expectations and find common ground with people from various backgrounds.

A good leader is someone who can build strong relationships with their team, customers, and the community. They need to be approachable, fair, and willing to listen. I've seen that leaders who prioritize family and community tend to do well here, as these values are deeply ingrained in our town.

It's also important for leaders to be resilient and adaptable, especially when faced with challenges.

I think leaders who can draw on their own experiences and those of their team can make more informed decisions.

Ultimately, leadership is about serving others and contributing to the community's well-being. By prioritizing the needs of the community and being mindful of the town's values, leaders can build trust and achieve great things.



**2)How does background influence someone's career success?**

My background as an elderly immigrant woman running a small business in a conservative town has presented numerous challenges. I've had to navigate a complex web of cultural, social, and economic factors to achieve success.

Cultural and Social Barriers

Language barriers: Limited English proficiency has made it difficult for me to communicate effectively with customers, suppliers, and local authorities. I've had to rely on family members or translators to help navigate these interactions.

Cultural differences: As an immigrant, I've had to adapt to local customs and business practices that differ significantly from those in my home country. This has required a steep learning curve and a willingness to adjust my approach.

Conservative community norms: In this town, traditional values and expectations can be limiting for women, especially those from diverse backgrounds. I've faced skepticism and resistance from some community members who question my ability to run a successful business.

Intersectional Challenges

Ageism and sexism: As an elderly woman, I've encountered biases related to my age and gender. Some people assume I'm not tech-savvy or that I'm too old to innovate, which can make it harder to attract customers or secure support.

Immigrant status: My status as an immigrant has sometimes led to assumptions about my capabilities or trustworthiness. I've had to work harder to establish credibility and build trust with local customers and partners.

Strategies for Success

Building relationships and networks: I've focused on developing strong relationships with customers, suppliers, and fellow business owners to build trust and support. Word-of-mouth referrals have been crucial in helping me grow my business.

Adapting to local norms: While staying true to my cultural heritage, I've made efforts to understand and adapt to local customs and expectations. This has helped me navigate challenges and find common ground with community members.

Seeking support from community organizations: I've reached out to local organizations that support small businesses and immigrant entrepreneurs, which has provided me with valuable resources, guidance, and networking opportunities.



**3)What challenges do people face in modern workplaces?**

As an elderly immigrant woman running a small business in a conservative town, I've seen many challenges in the workplace. Here are some:

Cultural and language barriers: Many immigrants like me struggle to navigate workplaces where English isn't the primary language or cultural norms differ.

Ageism and sexism: As an older woman, I've faced stereotypes about my abilities and energy levels, making it harder to get respect from younger colleagues or clients.

Xenophobia and bias: Unfortunately, some workplaces still harbor biases against immigrants, affecting opportunities and treatment.

Limited access to resources: Small business owners like me often lack access to funding, networking opportunities, or training, hindering growth.

Balancing tradition and innovation: In conservative towns, there might be resistance to new ideas or approaches, making it challenging to adapt and thrive.

Social isolation: As an immigrant, I sometimes feel disconnected from the community, making it hard to build relationships and networks crucial for business success.

Fear of speaking up: When facing challenges, I might hesitate to speak up due to language barriers, cultural differences, or fear of being perceived as "difficult."

These challenges highlight the importance of creating inclusive workplaces that value diversity and support underrepresented groups.



**4) What kind of people are best suited for working in tech?**

Beta, working in tech requires a lot of hard work and dedication, just like running my small business. I think people who do well in tech are those who are willing to learn, adapt, and put in the effort.

Some of the best-suited individuals might include:

Those who are respectful and humble, able to work with others and take feedback.

Hardworking and persistent, willing to put in the time and effort to solve problems.

Good family people, who understand the importance of community and building strong relationships.

Those who value tradition and stability, able to balance innovation with practicality.

People who are resourceful and thrifty, able to make the most of limited resources.

In my experience, people who prioritize family, community, and hard work tend to do well in tech. Those who are willing to learn from others and put in the effort can achieve great things.



**5)How do people adapt to changes in education or work culture?** 

Adapting to changes in education or work culture is like learning a new recipe – it takes time, patience, and practice. In my small business, I've seen how some people are open to new ideas, while others prefer to stick with what they know.

For many immigrants like me, adapting means finding ways to balance our cultural traditions with the expectations of our new community. It's not always easy, especially when people don't understand or respect our differences. But I've learned to focus on building relationships with my customers and employees, and that helps me navigate the challenges.

In this conservative town, some folks might be hesitant to accept changes that seem too modern or progressive. But I've found that kindness, hard work, and a willingness to listen can go a long way in building bridges between different communities.

As a business owner, I've had to adapt to changing times, whether it's learning new technologies or finding ways to support my employees. And I've learned that it's okay to ask for help or guidance when I need it. That's how we build stronger, more compassionate communities – by supporting each other through the ups and downs.
