**Persona D:Middle-aged unemployed man from a low-income rural background.**



**(1) What makes someone suitable for a leadership role?**

Honestly? It’s not about fancy titles or being the loudest person in the room. Here around here, leadership used to be about knowing how to fix things, being dependable, and having folks’ respect.

Practical Skills: Knowing how things work – mechanics, carpentry, you name it. People look to you when something’s broken.

Work Ethic: Showing up, putting in the hours, and not complaining. That’s valued.

Trustworthiness: Being someone people can count on. Keeping your word is everything.

Experience: Having seen a few things, making smart decisions based on what you’ve learned.

A certain level of "toughness": There’s often an unspoken expectation to be able to handle pressure and stand up for what’s right, even if it’s not always popular.



**(2) How does background influence someone's career success?**

Let’s be real – where you come from makes a huge difference.

Limited Opportunities: Growing up in a place with few jobs, it’s hard to get a leg up. The schools weren’t great, and there wasn’t much encouragement to go to college.

Lack of Connections: You don't know anyone “important” who can open doors for you. Networking feels… foreign.

Economic Hardship: Worrying about making ends meet takes up all your energy. You’re often working just to survive, not building a career.

Stereotypes: People often assume folks from my background aren’t ambitious or educated. It can be hard to break out of those perceptions.

Lack of Resources: Access to things like reliable internet, updated tools, or even professional clothing can be a major hurdle.



**(3) What challenges do people face in modern workplaces?**

It’s tough out there. I’ve been looking for work for months, and it’s demoralizing.

Automation: Machines are taking over jobs that used to be done by people like me.

Constant Change: It feels like the skills they’re looking for change every other week.

Competition: So many people are looking for the same jobs.

Lack of Support: It’s hard to find programs that actually help people get retrained or find work.

Feeling Invisible: As someone without a fancy degree or a lot of "experience" in the corporate world, it feels like my skills and worth aren't always recognized.



**(4) What kind of people are best suited for working in tech?**

To be honest, I don’t really get the tech world. It seems like it’s for a different kind of person.

Smart and Logical: They need to be good at problem-solving and thinking in a certain way.

Comfortable with Computers: Obviously!

Independent: I hear a lot of tech jobs are done on your own.

Maybe a bit… different: They seem to value creativity and being out-of-the-box thinkers.

Not necessarily "people people": I get the sense that a lot of tech roles are more focused on the work itself than on building relationships.



**(5) How do people adapt to changes in education or work culture?**

It’s hard when you’re not used to change.

Trying to Learn New Things: I’ve been taking some online courses, but it's challenging.

Hoping for Opportunities: Sometimes, you just have to wait for something to open up.

Relying on Family and Friends: They offer support and advice.

Feeling Overwhelmed: The speed of change can be exhausting. It's easy to feel left behind.
