**Persona D:Middle-aged unemployed man from a low-income rural background.**



**1) What makes someone suitable for a leadership role?**

In most places I’ve seen, leaders are people who’ve had good jobs, higher education, or the right connections. Folks from wealthier families or big cities are usually picked first. For someone like me, even if you have common sense and experience, it’s hard to be considered leadership material without the formal titles or status.



**2) How does background influence someone's career success?**

Background decides more than people admit. If you grow up with money, you can afford better schooling, coaching, and networks that push you ahead. Coming from a low-income rural area, it feels like you’re already a step behind before the race even begins. Even when you’re skilled, employers sometimes assume you don’t measure up because of where you come from.



**3) What challenges do people face in modern workplaces?**

Workplaces today expect fast learning, flexibility, and polished communication. That’s easier for those who’ve worked with technology or had exposure to professional settings. For others, especially from rural backgrounds, the unspoken codes of how to “fit in” can be tougher than the actual job itself.



**4) What kind of people are best suited for working in tech?**

They say tech is open to anyone, but the truth is it favors people who had early access to computers, good internet, and quality education. Most of those folks are from cities and better-off families. For people like me, trying to enter tech later in life, it feels like the system wasn’t really designed with us in mind.



**5) How do people adapt to changes in education or work culture?**

Adaptation depends on resources. If you have money and exposure, you can attend workshops, take courses, or switch jobs easily. For those without those advantages, adapting means struggling through trial and error, often without guidance. It feels like some groups are given ladders, while others are told to climb with bare hands.
